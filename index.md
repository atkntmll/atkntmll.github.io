### User Authentication

You can register and log in using JWT tokens, ensuring a secure experience. The dashboard uses Bcrypt to hash passwords for added security. Protected routes prevent unauthorized access.

### Task Management

Manage your tasks efficiently. You can:

- Create new tasks
- Read or view existing tasks
- Update tasks as needed
- Delete tasks when they are no longer required

Tasks are organized based on their due dates. You can mark tasks complete only if they are for today. Past tasks remain read-only to maintain your data integrity.

- Daily task completion rates
- Weekly progress with breakdowns by the day
- Monthly completion rates

The interactive visualizations using Chart.js help you understand your productivity trends over time.

### UI/UX Design

The dashboard features a minimal black-and-white theme for a neat, distraction-free experience. It adapts well to different screen sizes thanks to its responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
